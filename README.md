## Install

1. Clone this repository and navigate to diffusion-vla folder
```bash
git clone https://github.com/liyaxuanliyaxuan/TinyVLA
```

2. Install Package
```Shell
conda create -n tinyvla python=3.10 -y
conda activate tinyvla
pip install --upgrade pip  # 
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd policy_heads
pip install -e . 
# install llava-pythia
cd ../llava-pythia
pip install -e . 
```

## Data Preparation
1. Our data format is the same as [act](https://github.com/MarkFzp/act-plus-plus), so you need to transfer your data into h5py format. You can refer to the [rlds_to_h5py.py](https://github.com/lesjie-wen/tinyvla/blob/main/data_utils/rlds_to_h5py.py) which is used to transfer the data from rlds format to h5py format.
```angular2html
# h5 data structure
root
  |-action (100,10)
  |-language_raw (1,)
  |-observations
      |-images # multi-view
          |-left (100,480,640,3)
          |-right (100,480,640,3)
          |-wrist (100,480,640,3)
      |-joint_positions (100,7)
      |-qpos (100,7)
      |-qvel (100,7)
```
2. You have to add one entry in [constants.py](https://github.com/lesjie-wen/tinyvla/blob/main/aloha_scripts/constants.py) to specify the path of your data as follows.
```python
    'your_task_name':{
        'dataset_dir': DATA_DIR + '/your_task_path', # define the path of the dataset
        'episode_len': 1000, #max length of the episode,
        'camera_names': ['front', 'wrist'] # define the camera names which are used as the key when reading data
    }
```
## Download Pretrained VLM
We construct the VLM backbone by integrating a series of tiny LLM([Pythia](https://github.com/EleutherAI/pythia)) into [Llava](https://github.com/haotian-liu/LLaVA) framework. We follow the standard training pipe line and data provided by [Llava](https://github.com/haotian-liu/LLaVA). All the weights of VLM used in our paper are listed as following: 

| Model               | Usage         | Link                                                           |

| Llava-Pythia(~700M) | For TinyVLA-B | [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/lesjie/Llava-Pythia-700M) |
| Llava-Pythia(~1.3B) | For TinyVLA-H | [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/lesjie/Llava-Pythia-1.3B) |


## Train
The training script is "scripts/train.sh". And you need to change following parameters:
1. **OUTPUT** :refers to the save directory for training, which must include the keyword "llava_pythia" (and optionally "lora"). If LoRA training is used, the name must include "lora" (e.g., "llava_pythia_lora").
2. **task_name** :refers to the tasks used for training, which should be corresponded to "your_task_name" in aloha_scripts/constant.py
3. **model_name_or_path** :path to the pretrained VLM weights
4. Other hyperparameters like "batch_size", "save_steps" could be customized according to your computation resources.

Start training by following commands:
```shell
./scripts/train.sh
```

## Evaluation
Before evaluation, we provide a post process script to generate a usable and smaller weights.
The process script is "scripts/process_ckpts.sh". And you need to change following parameters:
1.  **source_dir** :path to trained VLA dir equals to **OUTPUT** in train.sh
2. **target_dir** :path to save processed VLA weights

You can refer to our evaluation script [eval_real_franka.py](https://github.com/lesjie-wen/tinyvla/blob/main/eval_real_franka.py).
